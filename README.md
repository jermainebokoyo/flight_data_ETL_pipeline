Flight Data ETL Pipeline

This ETL project is to create a data pipeline to collect and process flight data from FAA.
This project could involve extracting data from flight data files, flight sensors, and other data sources, then transforming this data into a standardized format to facilitate analysis and visualization. 
Finally, I plan on loading this into a central database to enable more in-depth analysis. 
This project could be used to improve flight safety, aircraft maintenance, and flight operations planning.
